# Missions is a "Space" themed To-do style app built using only VanillaJS. 

This project was centered around object oriented design and state management. When building the website, I first created all
my user defined objects, i.e. Mission, TaskSet, and Task, and created all helper functions for communicating between classes. 

State management was particulary tricky as all user interactions would require a UI update. This was handled with a custom built-in function call for 
DOM element on the page.

I also wanted to experiment with more Bootstrap design elements, so I made sure to include Bootstrap Modals for some nice visuals.
